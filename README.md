# Week 1 Refactor Challenge

## Refactoring an existing webpage to improve accessibility and streamline code of both the HTML and CSS.

## CONTENTS 
CONTENTS TABLE WI TH LINKS

### The motivation for this project was as foLlows:
- Use my knowledge of HTML and CSS language to improve and streamline the base code whilst keeping the website functional and identicle to the end user.
- Edit the html code in a way as to improve the page's accessibility to those with visual or aural impairmants.

### My actions
The changes I have made to both the HTML and the CSS files have cut a great deal of unnecessary code, making it easier and quicker to comprehend what is being done within the code itself.
For example, many elements within the index were in seperate classes but having the same CSS attributes, so removing the classes and creating a selector path to those elements uses far less code and makes the CSS easier to understand 

ADD SCREENSHOTS OF BEFORE AND AFTER

By adding semantic elements to the index I'm ensuring that the browser will recognise the function of each element and its contents, allowing for that information to be conveyed to the end user, should it be necessary.
This also negates many *div* elements that could be removed, tidying the code further

BEFORE AND AFTER

By re-ordering and classifying selectors in the CSS I have made it incredibly easy to find specific elements, should they need editing in the future.

BEFORE AND AFTER

### What I learned
- In working on this project I have realised the importance of semantic elements when creating a webpage; They clearly communicate the purpose of the content within the element to the browser, which can be invaluable to differently abled users.
- I learned the functions of many semantic elements myself and can now use them appropriately and with confidence in my own projects.
- I learned the importance of concise lines of code. keeping the functions clearly understandable to anyone who is working on any given project.
- I learned the importance of pushing files to GitHub frequently, as this acts as a safety net should something co catastrophically wrong with the code.

## Usage
This code functions identically as the original code, only offering more accessibility to users. No change regarding use is required.
